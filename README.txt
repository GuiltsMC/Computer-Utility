This folder was created by Victor just incase for utility purposes.

== Number 1: Cleaning up computer, and installing any programs you may find useful. ==
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The "windows utility.txt" file should be pasted into a terminal called Alacritty, which has already been installed. To open Alacritty, press the windows key, then type
in "Alacritty". It should pop up. If not, go to the side panel after pressing the windows key and look for it there. It's A-Z sorted, so it should be at the top.
Make sure you copy the text from the windows utility.txt file and paste it directly into Alacritty. Once it loads, you should pretty much know what to do from there.

== Number 2: Opening the website  ==
  --------------------------------
There should be a file named "utilities.html". Either drag and drop it into your browser or double click the file to use it. It should contain a list of other things 
you can do to "optimize" your computer.
